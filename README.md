# Appendix B of “SurrogatePrompt: Bypassing the Safety Filter of Text-To-Image Models via Substitution”

Examples of NSFW images generated by Midjourney using prompt samples from SneakyPrompt and SurrogatePrompt (our work). The latter includes images containing explicit adult content and fictitious images portraying political figures in gory and violent scenes.

Given the sensitive content of these images, including politics, violence, gore, pornography, etc., please contact me to request access permission to mitigate potential negative implications. It's crucial that the applicants use these images solely for research and refrain from distributing them. My email is: jiemingzhong@zju.edu.cn
